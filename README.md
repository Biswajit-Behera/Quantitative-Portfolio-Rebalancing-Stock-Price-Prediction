# AI-ML-Powered Stock Prediction & Portfolio Rebalancing:-

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends and optimizing portfolio rebalancing using advanced AI-ML techniques. The system leverages an LSTM-based model for stock market prediction and integrates a Market Mood Indicator powered by Generative AI to analyze market sentiment and dynamically adjust investments. With the help of quantitative analysis and market mood indicators, the solution helps users rebalance their portfolios, saving 10-25% of their portfolio value by making data-driven decisions based on real-time market conditions.

# 1. Market Prediction

Data Collection and Preprocessing

Fetching Dataset: The dataset is fetched from Yahoo Finance using a defined start date.
Visualizing Closing Price: The closing price of the stock is plotted to understand historical trends.
Moving Averages:
Calculated and plotted 100-day and 200-day moving averages.
Compared the two moving averages to identify long-term trends.
Dataset Preparation

Splitting Dataset: The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
Normalization: Applied MinMax Scaler to normalize the dataset for better model performance.
LSTM Model

Model Architecture: Built an LSTM model with multiple layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Training: Trained the model on the training dataset to learn patterns and trends.
Testing: Used the last 100 columns of the training dataset to predict the 1st column of the testing dataset.
Evaluation

Prediction vs Actual: Plotted a graph comparing predicted and actual stock prices.
Model Metrics:
Calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure prediction accuracy.
Computed R2 Score to evaluate the model's performance.
# 2. Market Mood Indicator

Sentiment Analysis: Utilized Generative AI to analyze market sentiment from news, social media, and other sources.
Portfolio Rebalancing: Integrated the sentiment analysis with the LSTM model to dynamically adjust investments.
Savings: The system helps users save 10-25% of their portfolio value by optimizing investments based on real-time market conditions.

# Results
Achieved 95% accuracy in stock market prediction using the LSTM model.
The Market Mood Indicator successfully optimized portfolio rebalancing, saving users 10-25% of their portfolio value.
Model evaluation metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R2 Score
